    "### Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency refers to the time delay between the initiation of a request and the response. In the context of distributed systems like Apache Spark, latency is a critical metric that affects the performance and responsiveness of data processing operations. Lower latency indicates faster processing and better user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Latency Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Network Latency**: The time taken for data to travel between two points over a network. In a typical data center, network latency can range from microseconds to milliseconds, depending on the distance and network conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disk Latency**: The time taken to read or write data from or to a disk. Disk latency is usually higher than network latency, ranging from milliseconds to seconds, depending on the disk type (e.g., HDD or SSD) and workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Latency**: The time taken to access data from memory. Memory latency is much lower than disk latency, typically in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing Latency**: The time taken to process data by a CPU or a computing unit. Processing latency can vary significantly based on the complexity of the computation and the hardware configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Memory Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory computation refers to the practice of processing data entirely in memory, avoiding or minimizing disk I/O operations. In-memory computation can significantly reduce latency compared to disk-based processing, as accessing data from memory is much faster than accessing it from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n",
    "\n",
    "// Performing a map transformation and collecting the result in memory\n",
    "val squaredRDD = rdd.map(x => x * x)\n",
    "val result = squaredRDD.collect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `map` transformation is performed entirely in memory, as Spark keeps the RDD partitions in memory across the cluster nodes. The `collect` action then retrieves the result back to the driver program, also operating in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of In-Memory Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Processing**: Accessing data from memory is much faster than accessing it from disk, leading to lower latency.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: In-memory computation can lead to improved performance for applications that require fast data processing.\n",
    "- **Reduced I/O Overhead**: By avoiding disk I/O operations, in-memory computation reduces the overhead associated with reading and writing data to disk."
